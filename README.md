Hi! This is a super quick project I made for fun to test out how to use binder (something that takes Jupyter Notebooks and runs them on a server)!

I used FastAI to train the model to create an animal classifer which can classify images of cardinals, chipmunks, crows, rabbits, robins, squirrels, and woodpeckers! I love walking in the forest all the time so I thought I'd make a little classifer of the animals that I see all the time!

Check it out! 

If you're having trouble with FastAi v4 Lesson 2 here are some errors I made and how to prevent it:
* Instead of Bing Images I used duck duck go. Just search it up and the function appears
* Make sure you have a requirements.txt or else it doesn't work (just copy and paste mine if you want)
* No need to do the Voila stuff on the main one or the short notebook, Binder will do it automatically for us

Feel free to email me at: dickson.wu654@gmail.com if you have any problems! I'll try my best to help out!
